# 🧠 My Journey in Data Science

Welcome to my public repository where I document my learning path and projects in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection - Logistic Regression
A machine learning project using logistic regression to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

- **Dataset**: Credit Card Transactions Dataset (CSV)
- **Goal**: Classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
- **Tech stack**:
  - Python
  - Pandas & NumPy
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn
  - scikit-learn

#### 🔍 Project Highlights:
- Data Cleaning and Exploration (EDA)
- Feature scaling and preprocessing
- Train/test split
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Accuracy, confusion matrix, and evaluation metrics
- Model tuning with `max_iter`
