# Projects_Data_Science


This repository contains a collection of data science projects I've worked on while learning and practicing different concepts.

Each project focuses on various topics such as:
- Data analysis and visualization
- Working with real-world datasets (CSV files)
- Machine learning models
- Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

All notebooks are clearly commented to make them easy to understand and follow.

## Purpose
To document my progress, learn by doing, and share useful work publicly.

More projects will be added over time.
